# odin-recipes

This repository contains a webpage of a few of my favorite recipes!

The purpose fo the project is to practice creating a webpage, adding different forms of text like headings, subheadings,
paragraphs, and lists. Along with adding text, it was also for practice inserting links and images.

Enjoy!
