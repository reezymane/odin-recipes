        <h3>Bibimbap Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 whole medjool dates, torn apart with your hands</li>
            <li>3 tbsp water</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2-3 tsp gochugaru, or 1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2.5 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp coconut aminos</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>Little salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp apple cider vinegar, or rice vinegar, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-1.5 tbsp avocado oil, to saute zucchini</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, pan fried sunny side up</li>
            <li>Cauliflower fried rice, or steamed white rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>For the zucchini, if using:</h3>
            <li>Slice the zucchini to a little thinner than ¼-inch (0.6 cm) in thickness or use a mandolin slicer. Sprinkle 1.5 tsp fine sea salt and gently rub the salt into each slice. Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes or up to 1 hour. Squeeze out the water then do a quick saute with avocado oil, garlic, and sesame oil. Sprinkle scallions and sesame seeds. Chill in the fridge.</li>
            <h3>For the carrots, mung bean sprouts, and spinach:</h3>
            <li>Julienne the carrots. These vegetables have the same cooking steps but please cook them separately. Bring a large pot of water to boil and season with some salt. Hot water blanches the carrots for 2 minutes, bean sprouts for 2 minutes, and spinach for 30 seconds. Soak in cold water and squeeze out the liquid. In a big mixing bowl, season each vegetable item with salt, garlic, sesame oil, scallions, and sesame seeds. Taste and adjust the salt quantity. Chill in the fridge. I like to add a tablespoon of coconut aminos for extra flavor but that’s totally optional.</li>
            <h3>For the bibimbap sauce:</h3>
            <li>In a small food processor, add the ingredients from the dates to salt. Blend a few times until you get a smooth paste. You might need to scrape the bowl a few times. Transfer the paste to a small bowl. Stir-in the sesame oil and vinegar. Adjust the vinegar quantity to taste.</li>
            <h3>To assemble:</h3>
            <li>Add the cooked rice (or cauliflower rice) to the bottom of serving bowls, place each vegetable item on top of the rice. I like to alternate the colors between the vegetables so they look colorful. Top with a sunny side up fried egg, a big spoonful of homemade bibimbap sauce, and a teaspoon sesame seeds. Mix it all up with a spoon and dig-in!</li>
        </ol>
